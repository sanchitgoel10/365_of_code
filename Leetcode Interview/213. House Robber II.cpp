/*This problem is a little tricky at first glance. However, if you have finished the House Robber problem, this problem can simply be decomposed into two House Robber problems.
Suppose there are n houses, since house 0 and n - 1 are now neighbors, we cannot rob them together and thus the solution is now the maximum of

Rob houses 0 to n - 2;
Rob houses 1 to n - 1.
The code is as follows. Some edge cases (n < 2) are handled explicitly.
