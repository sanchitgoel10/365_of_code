/*
This problem is recursive like dynamic programming.
Kth Permutation sequence can be formed by choosing the 1st digit and then the rest of the digits one by one.
Visually:
1 + (permutations of rest of digits)
2 + (permutations of ...)
so on...

For N=3,
we have the permutations:
1|2,3
1|3,2
2|1,3
2|3,1
3|1,2
3|2,1

I put a bar "|" to separate first digit from the rest of digits.
There are a total of N! = 3! = 6 perms. Each 1st digit is "attached" to (n-1)! =2! = 2 permutations formed by rest of digits.
Thus , to choose 1st digit, simply calculate (k-1) / (n-1)! and use it to index into an array of digits 1,2,3,
Once 1st digit is chosen, we choose 2nd and so on recursively.
