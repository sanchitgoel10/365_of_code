If there is no duplicate in the array, we can map each indexes to each numbers in this array. In other words, we can have a mapping function f(index) = number
For example, let's assume
nums = [2,1,3], then the mapping function is 0->2, 1->1, 2->3.
If we start from index = 0, we can get a value according to this mapping function, and then we use this value as a new index and, again, we can get the other new value according to this new index. We repeat this process until the index exceeds the array. Actually, by doing so, we can get a sequence. Using the above example again, the sequence we get is 0->2->3. (Because index=3 exceeds the array's size, the sequence terminates!)

However, if there is duplicate in the array, the mapping function is many-to-one.
For example, let's assume
nums = [2,1,3,1], then the mapping function is 0->2, {1,3}->1, 2->3. Then the sequence we get definitely has a cycle. 0->2->3->1->1->1->1->1->........ The starting point of this cycle is the duplicate number.
We can use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm to find the starting point.

According to Floyd's algorithm, first step, if a cycle does exist, and you advance the tortoise one node each unit of time but the hare two nodes each unit of time, then they will eventually meet. This is what the first while loop does. The first while loop finds their meeting point.

*Second step, take tortoise or hare to the start point of the list (i.e. let one of the animal be 0) and keep the other one staying at the meeting point. Now, advance both of the animals one node each unit of time, the meeting point is the starting point of the cycle. This is what the second while loop does. The second while loop finds their meeting point.

*Proof of second step:

Distance traveled by tortoise while meeting = x + y

Distance traveled by hare while meeting = (x + y + z) + y = x + 2y + z

Since hare travels with double the speed of tortoise,

so 2(x+y)= x+2y+z => x+2y+z = 2x+2y => x=z

Hence by moving tortoise to start of linked list, and making both animals to move one node at a time, they both have same distance to cover .

They will reach at the point where the loop starts in the linked list

I'd put it this way:

Let count be the number of elements in the range 1 .. mid, as in your solution.

If count > mid, then there are more than mid elements in the range 1 .. mid and thus that range contains a duplicate.

If count <= mid, then there are n+1-count elements in the range mid+1 .. n. That is, at least n+1-mid elements in a range of size n-mid. Thus this range must contain a duplicate.
