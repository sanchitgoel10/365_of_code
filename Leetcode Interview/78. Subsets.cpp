/*Iterative

Using [1, 2, 3] as an example, the iterative process is like:

Initially, one empty subset [[]]
Adding 1 to []: [[], [1]];
Adding 2 to [] and [1]: [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]];
Adding 3 to [], [1], [2] and [1, 2]: [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]].

/*Bit Manipulation

To give all the possible subsets, we just need to exhaust all the possible combinations of the numbers. And each number has only two possibilities: either in or not in a subset. And this can be represented using a bit.

Using [1, 2, 3] as an example, 1 appears once in every two consecutive subsets, 2 appears twice in every four consecutive subsets, and 3 appears four times in every eight subsets (initially all subsets are empty):

[], [ ], [ ], [    ], [ ], [    ], [    ], [       ]
[], [1], [ ], [1   ], [ ], [1   ], [    ], [1      ]
[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [ ], [1   ], [2   ], [1, 2   ]
[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]
