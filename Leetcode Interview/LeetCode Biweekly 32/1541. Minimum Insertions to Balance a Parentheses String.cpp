/*
We keep 2 variables, ans A counter for manual addition brackets and req Number of closing brackets that we need .
We start iterating over the string elements one by one. Now:-
1. We get an open bracket
In this, we have 2 things to understand

For every open bracket, we need 2 closed brackets.
req += 2
Now if I have an odd number of closed brackets, this means that we have one ) for one of the (, and now we have another open bracket. As the question says Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis ')), so we need to give a ) to the existing open bracket, and then process the new one.
ans++ => We added a new closed bracket req-- => the existing lonely ) is paired and not needed now
2. We encounter a closed bracket
In this, we again have two things to understand:

If we encounter a lone warrior, basically a ) when req = 0, this means we can manually add a ( and then say that we encountered ().
ans++ => We added a new open bracket
req++ => Another closed bracket is required as we have ()
Otherwise, we directly reduce the number of required closed brackets.
req--
Code: - (C++ O(n))
