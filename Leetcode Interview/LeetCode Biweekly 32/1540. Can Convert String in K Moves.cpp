/*
Basic idea is to convert str1 to str2 using less or equal to k iterations where in ith iteration you can choose atmost one character to shift exactly i places.

Intuition :

if string size is not equal, return false;
use a hashmap to check how many times the diff is same and keep using the iteration with the formula (26 *(num of occurreces of same diff) + diff;
For eg. "abc" -> "bcd", diff for a -> b is 1 and we can check hashmap for occurences of diff as following:

hashMap = {....... {1 = 0}....}
We can use iteration 1 in this case and we update the hashmap to the following to denote that 1 iteration has already been used.
hashMap = {....... {1 = 1}....}

Now to shift b -> c also we need 1 Iteration,which is already being used.
hashMap = {....... {1 = 1}....}

Since 1 iteration is already being used, we can use 26 + 1, and update hash map :
hashMap = {....... {1 = 2}....}
and we also keep track of the maximum iteration found so far.
...
...
and so on.

Finally if max iteration <= k return true.

Note: Please upvote if you find this useful, this motivates me to write more descriptive solutions
