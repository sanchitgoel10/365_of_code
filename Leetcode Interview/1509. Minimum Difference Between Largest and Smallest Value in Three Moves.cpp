/*
We have 4 plans:

kill 3 biggest elements
kill 2 biggest elements + 1 smallest elements
kill 1 biggest elements + 2 smallest elements
kill 3 smallest elements

Example from @himanshusingh11:

A = [1,5,6,13,14,15,16,17]
n = 8

Case 1: kill 3 biggest elements

All three biggest elements can be replaced with 14
[1,5,6,13,14,15,16,17] -> [1,5,6,13,14,14,14,14] == can be written as A[n-4] - A[0] == (14-1 = 13)

Case 2: kill 2 biggest elements + 1 smallest elements

[1,5,6,13,14,15,16,17] -> [5,5,6,13,14,15,15,15] == can be written as A[n-3] - A[1] == (15-5 = 10)

Case 3: kill 1 biggest elements + 2 smallest elements

[1,5,6,13,14,15,16,17] -> [6,6,6,13,14,15,16,16] == can be written as A[n-2] - A[2] == (16-6 = 10)

Case 4: kill 3 smallest elements

[1,5,6,13,14,15,16,17] -> [13,13,13,13,14,15,16,17] == can be written as A[n-1] - A[3] == (17-13 = 4)

Answer is minimum of all these cases!
